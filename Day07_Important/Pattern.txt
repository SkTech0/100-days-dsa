30-SECOND PATTERN DECISION FLOWCHART (MENTAL VERSION)

When you read the problem, ask in this exact order:

Step 1️⃣: Is the data continuous / contiguous?

Words: subarray, substring, window

YES → Go to Step 2

NO → Go to Step 5

Step 2️⃣: Are all numbers non-negative?

YES → Sliding Window

NO → Prefix Sum + HashMap

📌 Why: Sliding window needs monotonic behavior.

Step 3️⃣: Is it asking for longest / shortest / count?

Longest / shortest → Sliding Window

Count of exact value → Prefix Sum

Step 4️⃣: Does shrinking the window risk missing answers?

YES → Prefix Sum

NO → Sliding Window

Step 5️⃣: Is the array sorted?

YES → Two Pointers

NO → Hashing

Step 6️⃣: Are you asked for pairs / triplets / closeness?

YES + Sorted → Two Pointers

YES + Unsorted → Hashing

Step 7️⃣: Is there a cycle / repetition / linked list?

YES → Fast & Slow Pointers

Step 8️⃣: Is it asking for shortest path / minimum steps?

YES → BFS

NO → DFS / Backtracking

Step 9️⃣: Does the problem say “all possible”?

YES → Backtracking

NO → Continue

Step 🔟: Does local choice affect future choices?

YES → Dynamic Programming

NO → Greedy
